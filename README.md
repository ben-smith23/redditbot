# Project 4: Reddit bot

Bot: swampboybot

[Project instructions](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci040/tree/2022fall/project_04)

## Who does this bot support and why?
My bot is supporting Arizona Senator Mark Kelly.  I am not from Arizona, but I like his platform and I am all for having more astronauts in Congress.

## Favorite thread with bot

I used Markovify to respond to comments. I enjoy reading what it puts out because I trained it on a book called <i>A Better Politics</i> by Danny Dorling, <i>A Better Politics</i> by Danny Dorling, John Locke's <i>Two Treatises of Government</i>, and an essay I wrote for a Constitutional Law I took last year. The outputs usually do not make much sense, but are written in a very pretentious way, so it reminds me of people on the internet with an intellectual superiority complex.

When posting top comments, I stuck with my madlibs because they make bit more sense.
